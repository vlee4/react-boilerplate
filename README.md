# React Boilerplate

This is a React boilerplate project that is planned to utilize:
- Webpack: to bundle js files for the browser
- Babel: to transpile ES6 to earlier versions of JavaScript for older browswer version
- Express: to set up static middleware and a simple server

## Status

Up-to-date React app loads after compiling with `npm run build` and then running with `npm run dev`, but the app does not hot reload based on frontend changes.
